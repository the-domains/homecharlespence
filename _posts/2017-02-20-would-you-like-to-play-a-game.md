  Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve had an idea for some awesome games! I
  know, I’m not really a gamer but that doesn’t mean I can’t have an idea for a
  bad ass game! Anyways, I’ve decided to learn to write games with Unity 3D. As
  I work through the courses that I have on Unity Game Development, I’ll post my
  accomplishments here.

# Would you like to play a game?

Over the past couple of weeks, I've had an idea for some awesome games! I know, I'm not really a gamer but that doesn't mean I can't have an idea for a bad ass game! Anyways, I've decided to learn to write games with Unity 3D. As I work through the courses that I have on Unity Game Development, I'll post my accomplishments [here][0].
